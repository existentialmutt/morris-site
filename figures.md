# First Set of Figures

## [Swagger Round](#swagger-round)

## [Heading Up](#heading-up)

Main Idea: Switch from set formation (2 vertical lines) to 2 horizontal lines, facing up.

1-4 form front line, 5-8 form back line

1 and 2, and 5 and 6 stay in place, just rotating to face up and then back into set
3 and 4, and 7 and 8, come to outside, aiming to be in place after first doublestep

Figure position:

```					

        4			8
  
        2			6
Up											Down
        1			5

        3			7

```
Heading up has several variations:

Sheriffâ€™s Ride: 4 doublesteps, 2 closed sidesteps (first left, then right), swingbacks

Vandals: 4 doublesteps, swingbacks

Castle Ring + I-91 : 4 doublesteps, swingbacks, galley up

title: Paintbrush Jig
---
For 3

**Music**--Cock of the North<br> 
**Props**: Six big paintbrushes and three paint buckets filled with water. 

Three dancers walk in to a close circle with buckets, and place them by their right feet.

**Chorus**: Facing center of circle--<br>
Dip right, flick right, dip right, flick left/Lichfield caper <br>
Dip left, flick left, dip left, flick right/Lichfield caper<br>

**Figures**: Turn left: one double step traveling out, one double step turning, then one double step back to the next position to your left (finish step with a quick dip) and caper. 
(At the end each dancer has rotated one position to the left.)

First figure, caper is Lichfield; second scissors; third castle ring. 

Finish with castle ring caper: then kick bucket (intentionally) while walking away from middle into crowd. 

Notes:
Practice escalation: splash audience more than fellow dancers as dance progresses.

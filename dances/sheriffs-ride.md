## Chorus

Main Idea: 2 Bunnies, Lichfield Caper (x2)

Bunnies:

Legs: bend knees slightly, then straighten knees and up on toes.
Hands: Start with hands limp, almost touching each other, at chest height, then extend and flick hankies over the head of your opposite.

Lichfield caper:

Start caper with a hop a little bit backwards, finish caper with a hop back into original set position. First Lichfield caper is on right, second on left.


## Ending

At end of last chorus, instead of 2nd Lichfield, plain capers to face up.  To walk off, everyone follows #1, even side turning over their right shoulders.

## Notes
What's a pull down? On third beat (hop without changing feet), pull down (hands up to about chest height, then snap down) instead of showing up.

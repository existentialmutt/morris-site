## Structure

Hankies

**[Step in Line](/figures#step-in-line)**: outside foot

**Chorus**

**[Crossing Over](/figures#crossing-over)**: outside foot

**Chorus**

**[Back to Back](/figures#back-to-back)**: right foot

**Chorus**

**[Rounds for Four](/figures#rounds-for-four)**: right foot

**Chorus**

**[Doubling Up](/figures#doubling-up)**: right foot; Note absence of Rounds for 4

**Last Chorus**: When in inverted set, don’t caper back to place, but instead on the capers everyone turns to face up (turning out/away), and back row comes up a bit, to end on right side of partner, so all 8 end up in a line facing up.

## Chorus

Main Idea: <br>
* closed side steps to form inverted set
* big steps in square formation to form new inverted set facing down
* more open side steps
* caper home

**2 closed side steps**: start outside foot, closed side step with outside foot.  1&2 and 5&6 move in toward each other on first one, stay there on second.  3&4 and 7&8 move out and up to end up in a “heading up(/figures#heading-up)” inverted set.  These latter pairs start moving in the “opposite” direction that their feet want to move for a closed side step, and they are moving in the “opposite” direction from how they show on the first side step (show in); this takes some practice.  In other words, they do a closed side step in, but they do it moving in an up and out direction.

**4 big steps**: All take 4 big steps, with hankies showing in above-the-head circles as with plan capers.  All end up facing down, with those on the outside ending up inside and vice versa, so they end in this position:
```
1  3  4  2
5  7  8  6
   Down
```
They get there by walking around an imaginary rectangle, as follows.  Those who start on the outside (3&4, 7&8) walk (1) out, (2) down, (3) in, (4) in (90 degree turns for changes in direction).  Those start on the inside (1&2, 5&6) walk (1) out, (2) out, (3) down, (4) in.

**2 closed side steps**: Two closed side steps in place, first out, then in (this should match what foot everyone is “naturally” on if they started the chorus with their outside foot).

**Caper back home**: Everyone does 4 plain capers back to place, turning out/away.  The top row turns out/away, with 1&2 moving up to place and 3&4 staying roughly where they are.  7&8 move down and turn the easy way.  5&6 stay roughly where they are.  I’m not sure how they turn?

## Ending

When in inverted set, don’t caper back to place, but instead on the capers everyone turns to face up (turning out/away), and back row comes up a bit, to end on right side of partner, so all 8 end up in a line facing up.

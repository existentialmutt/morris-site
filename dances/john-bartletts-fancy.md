## Structure

Hankies

**[Step in Line](/figures#step-in-line)**: outside foot

**Chorus**

**[Crossing Over](/figures#crossing-over)**: outside foot

**Chorus**

**[Back to Back](/figures#back-to-back)**: right foot

**Chorus**

**[Rounds for Four](/figures#rounds-for-four)**: right foot

**Chorus**

**[Doubling Up](/figures#doubling-up)**: right foot; Note absence of Rounds for 4

**Last Chorus**: When in inverted set, don’t caper back to place, but instead on the capers everyone turns to face up (turning out/away), and back row comes up a bit, to end on right side of partner, so all 8 end up in a line facing up.

## Chorus

Main Idea: <br>
* open side steps to form inverted set
* big steps in square formation to form new inverted set facing down
* more open side steps
* caper home

**2 open side steps**: start inside foot, open side step with inside foot.  1&2 and 5&6 move in toward each other on first one, stay there on second.  3&4 and 7&8 move out and up to end up in a “heading up(/figures#heading-up)” inverted set.  These latter pairs start moving in the “opposite” direction that their feet want to move for an open side step, and they are moving in the “opposite” direction from how they show on the first side step; this takes some practice.

**4 big steps**: All take 4 big steps, with hankies showing in above-the-head circles as with plan capers.  All end up facing down, with those on the outside ending up inside and vice versa, so they end in this position:
```
1  3  4  2
5  7  8  6
   Down
```
They get there by walking around an imaginary rectangle, as follows.  Those who start on the outside (3&4, 7&8) walk (1) out, (2) down, (3) in, (4) in (90 degree turns for changes in direction).  Those start on the inside (1&2, 5&6) walk (1) out, (2) out, (3) down, (4) in.

**2 open side steps**: Two open side steps in place, first out, then in (this should match what foot everyone is “naturally” on if they started the chorus with their inside foot).

**Caper back home**: Everyone does 4 plain capers back to place, turning out/away.  The top row turns out/away, with 1&2 moving up to place and 3&4 staying roughly where they are.  7&8 move down and turn the easy way.  5&6 stay roughly where they are.  I’m not sure how they turn?

## Ending

When in inverted set, don’t caper back to place, but instead on the capers everyone turns to face up (turning out/away), and back row comes up a bit, to end on right side of partner, so all 8 end up in a line facing up.

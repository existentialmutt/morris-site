## Structure

3 person jig.  Hankies.

All the videos we've seen have been slightly different than what follows.
This version matches the Green Man Morris version from Tony's videos and seems
to match reasonably with the version written up in the "Lichfield Morris"
document.


    A1: 2 double steps, Lichfield caper
    A2: 2 double steps, Lichfield caper

    B1: Hold hands and lean into circle.  4 steps around to left.  Lichfield caper
    B2: Hold hands and lean into circle.  4 steps around to right.  Lichfield caper.

    A1: 2 double steps. Lichfield caper
    A2: 2 double steps. Lichfield caper
    A3: 2 double steps. 2 side steps

    B1: Dancer #1 2 double steps (or really 1.5).  Sits on others' hands.  Beat 1: swing forward.  Beat 2: swing back.  Beat 3: throw forward.  Beat 4: land.
    B2: repeat for dancer #2.
    B3: repeat for dancer #3.

    A1: 2 double steps. Lichfield caper
    A2: 2 double steps. Lichfield caper
    A3: 2 double steps. 2 side steps

    B1: Dancer #1 2 double steps.  Castle Ring caper (getting extra height with a push off the other two dancers.
    B2: repeat for dancer #2.
    B3: repeat fro dancer #3, except they get caught on the jump and stay aloft.


It would be reasonable to shorten the dance in the following way: In the second
and third "A" parts, replace A2 with A3, resulting in only 2 A's.  I am
undecided about whether this is better or worse.  It is reasonable to interpret
the "Lichfield Morris" document in either way, and one of the other videos
shows this variation.

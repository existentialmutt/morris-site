title: Vandalls of Hammerwich
history: |
  Traditional.  Here is one explanation for the name (from
  [tunearch.org](https://tunearch.org/wiki/Annotation:Vandalls_of_Hammerwich_(1))):
  Hammerwich is a nearby village, situated on a hill about three miles
  south-west of Lichfield once served by both canal and railway. The name
  ‘Hammerwich’ means a place by a hill from the Anglo-Saxon words ‘wic’ meaning
  ‘place’ and hammer meaning ‘hill’ [1] In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was
  called Humeruuich. Local lore gives that the dance refers to an incident in
  the early middle Ages when some of the Hammerwich inhabitants set fire to
  woods in Cannock Forest, an event mentioned in the Staffordshire Pleas of the
  Forest (14th, Jan., 1262): "...a certain heath was burnt by the vills of
  Hamerwich, to the injury of the King's game..."

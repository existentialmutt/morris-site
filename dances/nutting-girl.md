Double Jig for 2 or more dancers.  Description below is for 2 dancers; for more
dancers, one or both dancers are replaced with a group.

## Structure (Short Version)


Main Idea: Each figure and chorus is danced twice, once by each dancer.  Before
each figure and chorus, dancers prepare to enter with 4 Swingbacks.  After each
figure, dancers “leave” by walking down while the other dancer enters.


**Figure 1: Foot Up**:  4 Double Steps, 2 Closed Side Steps, Galley Right


**Chorus**


**Figure 2: Lichfield Capers**: 4 Lichfield Capers (travel in a circle, music plays slows), 2 Closed Side Steps to Front & Center, Galley Right


**Chorus**


**Figure 3: Castlering Capers**: 4 Castle Ring Capers (facing North-South-East-West, music plays slows), 2 Closed Side Steps to Front & Center, Galley Right


**Chorus**: During group B's final Chorus, group A joins for Swingbacks + Foot Up.  Replace the final Galley with 4 Plain Capers

## Chorus

2 Double steps across to the other side (travel on 1, 1 in place)
